<p><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1 - Pseudopandemic</b></p>

<p>COVID 19 was a  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i>. The threat level suggested by those running the
 <i class="calibre4">psychological operation</i> was a lie. It was a fraud designed to fool you into 
abandoning your inalienable rights and freedoms. The  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> objective 
was to enable the reset of the global economy, the world's monetary system and its 
political and social structure, simply to further their own interests. </p>

<p>We are going to examine the evidence which exposes the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> fraud 
and the likely perpetrators. The evidence is cited throughout. Please check it 
yourself, look for more and make up your own mind. We will necessarily cover 
some extremely contentious issues and you probably won't agree with some of the 
conclusions drawn. This is as it should be. </p>

<p>Disagreement and open, evidence-based dialogue is a vital component of any 
healthy, free society. One of the travesties of the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> has been the 
erosion of critical debate. However, it was designed to lay the foundation of a global
tyranny and no totalitarian system can tolerate dissent. </p>

<p>The COVID 19  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> wasn't the first <i class="calibre4"> pseudopandemic</i> but it was the first
to be fully implemented and exploited. It seems previous attempts may have been 
trial runs. </p>

<p>This time, those responsible, having learned from their previous ef<a href="https://archive.is/9BXtY">forts, thoroughly </a>
<a href="https://archive.is/9BXtY">prepared [1] for their </a> <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> operation. They perfected the strategies and
techniques required to convince the population that the scale of the public health 
threat was overwhelming. In reality, as  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> proponents admit, it was 
the least significant pandemic humanity has faced in the last 2000 years. They even
had to change the definition of  <i class="calibre4">”pandemic” </i> to describe it as such. </p>

<p>The COVID 19  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> crime moved the  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> much closer to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107061229/https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/21252030%20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable%20Development%20web.pdf">their longstanding objectives [2]. On this</a> occasion the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> delivered on its earlier promise. </p>

<p>While this  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> was fundamentally a deception, this doesn't suggest 
that pandemics aren't a genuine threat. Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) is a truly 
terrifying disease. It has the potential to become a deadly global pandemic. 
Throughout history, pandemics have threatened populations and we have every 
reason to be wary of the next. COVID 19 just wasn’t one of them. </p>

<p>Seen by many as one of the world's leading public health experts, Bill Gates 
referred<a href="https://archive.is/1xjEg"> to COVID 19 as Pandemic One [3]. He wrote:</a></p>

<p> <i class="calibre4">"I grew up learning that World War II was the defining moment of our </i>
 <i class="calibre4">parents’ generation. In a similar way, the COVID-19 pandemic&mdash;the first </i>
 <i class="calibre4">modern pandemic&mdash;will define this era. No one who lives through </i>
 <i class="calibre4">Pandemic One will ever forget it." </i></p>

<p>COVID 19 was a  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic </i> because a powerful group capitalised upon a 
respiratory disease, with a relatively low mortality rate, to create the illusion of a 
dangerous global pathogen. COVID 19 itself wasn't a  <i class="calibre4">"hoax." </i> While the cause of the
disease and its origin are debatable, people certainly became ill, some seriously 
and sadly many died. </p>

<p>COVID 19 was a disease with specific symptoms which required very careful 
medical diagnosis. Otherwise the wider<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200731154213/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160299/"> set of symptoms could appear largely </a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200731154213/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160299/">indistinguishable [4] from other</a> respiratory illnesses and the risk of misdiagnosis was high. This risk was compounded by the global reliance upon tests which were 
not diagnostic tools and were incapable of identifying a COVID 19  <i class="calibre4">“case.” </i></p>

<p>Unusually, the hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels) and hypercapnia (high blood Co2 
levels) seen in genuine COVID 19 cases<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200613125044/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-020-06033-2"> did not appear to correspond [5] to the</a> 
expected loss of respiratory system compliance, common to other causes of Acute 
Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS.) These specific COVID 19 symptoms could 
only be revealed through detailed medical examination. No test in isolation was 
capable of identifying COVID 19. </p>

<p>Far from protecting the public from the disease, the policy response to COVID 19 
caused immense additional suffering. Many people died before their time as a direct
result of political decisions. If we acknowledge that this was a contrived event, we 
must also conclude that the perpetrators were willing to use policy as a weapon to 
cause additional deaths in pursuit of their objectives. </p>

<p>History is littered with tyrannical despots who killed people for their own ambitions. 
We have done nothing to guard against this happening again. In many respects the 
perpetual push towards the centralisation of global authority, coupled with ever 
more sophisticated and devastating weapons of mass destruction, has increased 
the risk of genocide. </p>

<p>In a June 2020 interview, convened by the US Chamber of Commerce, Bill Gates 
warned the world about the next pandemic. He has an intimate knowledge of the 
deliberations of the World Health Organisation; he has access to the latest public 
health research, related science and predictions. We would be wise to take note of 
his words:</p>

<p> <i class="calibre4">"We will have to prepare for the next one. That, you know...I'd </i>
 <i class="calibre4">say.....er......will get attention next time." </i></p>

<p>While the COVID 19  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> was essentially a confidence trick, this 
doesn't mean the next pandemic won't pose a real global health threat. It would be 
foolish to imagine that people who are capable of orchestrating the 
 <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> wouldn't be willing to exploit a far more deadly contagion. </p>

<p>Nor does it suggest there is no need to observe proper public health standards or 
maintain effective health monitoring systems. In fact, awareness of the 
 <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> demands that we do. If our current systems weren't so corrupt 
x
<a id="calibre_link-27"></a>Pseudopandemic
perhaps we could have both spotted the deception and implemented a more 
effective public health response to COVID 19. </p>

<p>The  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> is first and foremost a crime. There are real people who are 
guilty of it. This book is written in the firm hope that the plan ultimately fails and that 
we never allow our society to be manipulated by criminals again. </p>

<p>A crime consists of specific elements. It must be a voluntary act or wilful omission 
( <i class="calibre4">actus reus</i>) driven by dishonourable or mendacious intent ( <i class="calibre4">mens rea</i> - guilty mind). 
It must also contravene a law. In this case the COVID 19  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> appears 
to be both a conspiracy to commit fraud (under Common Law) or a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_criminal_enterprise"> Joint Criminal </a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_criminal_enterprise">Enterprise [6] (under International</a> Law.)</p>

<p>In order to convict the perpetrators of the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> fraud, a jury would need
to see evidence of the  <i class="calibre4">categorical trinity</i>. They must be satisfied, beyond any 
reasonable doubt, that the accused had the means, motive and opportunity to 
commit the crime. </p>

<p>Obviously a global  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> is no ordinary fraud. The scale is immense and
the complicit number in millions. However, the vast majority involved in perpetuating
the scam were innocent. They demonstrated neither  <i class="calibre4">actus reus</i> nor  <i class="calibre4">mens rea</i>. Just 
like the billions of victims around the world, they too were duped. </p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, in order for a global conspiracy to work, there is no need 
for a large number of conspirators. In fact, if the conspiracy stands any chance of 
success, it is vital that only a few have any knowledge of it. The more people who 
know, the more likely it is to fail. </p>

<p>A small number of people exerting world-wide control over vast, complex systems is
nothing unusual. There are many multinational corporations and government 
agencies who manage global operations using this top down, compartmentalised, 
authoritarian structure. </p>

<p>Nor is it cheap. Only those with the deepest pockets can possibly be the architects 
of the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic. </i> The guilty are among their number. </p>

<p>At this stage all we can have are suspicions. In order to formally identify the guilty 
we would first need to launch a truly independent global investigation. Only the 
evidence can reveal the suspects and only lawfully convened juries, invested with 
all judicial  <i class="calibre4">authority</i>, can consider that evidence and convict the guilty on its merits. </p>

<p>For this reason all individuals and organisations named in this book are rightfully 
considered innocent until proven guilty. No crime is alleged against anyone or any 
group. </p>

<p>Centralised global authority and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(information_security)"> compartmentalisation [7] enabled the</a> COVID 19 
 <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> to pass largely undetected. While the voices challenging the 
 <i class="calibre4">"official narrative" </i> were many, they remained a minority. Their objections and the 
evidence they presented was widely censored and the broader population accepted
xi
<a id="calibre_link-28"></a>Pseudopandemic
the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic </i> story. The vast majority were deceived into believing they 
faced a genuine global pandemic and a severe public health threat. </p>

<p>The evidence is now incontrovertible. The  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> was a psychological 
operation used to control billions through fear. By looking at this evidence we can 
identify the suspects who had the means, opportunity and motive to commit the 
greatest fraud ever perpetrated on humanity. </p>

<p>Centralised authority combined with thorough planning and preparation made the 
 <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> possible. This enabled a tiny group of  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> to control 
the behaviour of billions. </p>

<p>They abused our trust and sold us nothing but disinformation. Billions of us believe 
that the global system of authority has our best interests at heart. Consequently we 
were willing to comply with our orders, wrongly assuming they were intended to 
 <i class="calibre4">keep us safe</i>. </p>

<p>This belief in benign authority isn't rational. History should teach us to be sceptical. 
Unfortunately, our collective faith in authority allowed the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> to 
proceed largely unchecked. </p>

<p>When a  <i class="calibre4">global health authority</i> told us the threat level was severe we were already 
programmed to accept it. The global authority had no need to prove anything. A 
simple declaration sufficed, as their authoritarian status imbued them with the 
power to define reality. No lesser authority could challenge them. </p>

<p>The  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> control the system of global, compartmentalised authority. 
For the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> to succeed they only needed to command a small cadre 
of well placed individuals. <a href="https://tragedyandhope.com/rings-within-rings-how-secret-societies-direct-world-politics/">They formed the inner </a>

<a href="https://tragedyandhope.com/rings-within-rings-how-secret-societies-direct-world-politics/">    [8], protecting</a> the  <i class="calibre4">core </i>
 <i class="calibre4">conspirators. </i> We will refer to these individuals as the  <i class="calibre4">informed influencers. </i></p>

<p> <i class="calibre4">Informed influencers</i> were tasked to facilitate the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> by exercising 
their invested authority. They worked at the intergovernmental, governmental and 
corporate level to further  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic </i> objectives. For the plan to work, the 
 <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> required only that the  <i class="calibre4">informed</i>  <i class="calibre4">influencers</i> were committed to the 
cause. No one else needed to have any idea about the nature of the deception. In 
fact, it was essential that they didn't. </p>

<p>The  <i class="calibre4">informed influencer's</i> role was twofold. Firstly they had to convince their 
colleagues, and their wider networks, that the claimed threat level was real. 
 <i class="calibre4">Informed influencers</i> were placed within academic and scientific bodies to achieve 
this. Once convinced, the remaining  <i class="calibre4">deceived influencers</i> unwittingly contributed 
towards the success of the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i>. </p>

<p>The  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> initial goal was to create a global policy response to the 
 <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> that would lay the foundations for their longer term objectives. 
The  <i class="calibre4">deceived</i>  <i class="calibre4">influencers</i> genuinely believed these policies were necessary to 
combat the perceived scale of the threat. Once careers were invested in the 
deception, even those who perhaps realised they were complicit, were unable, or 
unwilling, to stop the policy juggernaut. </p>

<p>This left the  <i class="calibre4">informed influencers</i> free to shape policies which, had the scale of the 
threat been genuine, would have made no sense. These policies were specifically 
designed to instil fear in the public, reinforce the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> narrative and 
introduce the population to new forms of dictatorial governance. </p>

<p>The seismic shift towards new technocratic social control systems would not have 
been possible unless the population were terrorised. Once the people were suitably
cowed, the  <i class="calibre4">informed influencers</i> were able to use the cover of the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> 
to create the form of governance (technocracy) the  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators </i> ultimately 
desired. </p>

<p>Fearing COVID 19 and trusting  <i class="calibre4">the authorities</i>, the global population was deceived. 
The only remaining task for the  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> was to command the narrative. As
they own and control most of the world's<a href="https://www.mediareform.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Who-Owns-the-UK-Media_final2.pdf"> mainstream media [9] (MSM) this wasn' </a>t too difficult. </p>

<p>Any who were suspicious, or those who asked questions likely to expose the 
 <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i>, regardless of their qualifications or<a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/blogs/not-led-by-science"> experience, were isolated and</a>
<a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/blogs/not-led-by-science">attacked [10] by the MSM. With marginally</a> less control over social media, the  <i class="calibre4">core</i> <i class="calibre4">conspirators</i><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/misinformation-infodemic-world-vs-virus-podcast/"> had to accuse</a>
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/misinformation-infodemic-world-vs-virus-podcast/"> </a>
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/misinformation-infodemic-world-vs-virus-podcast/"> all who  questioned them</a>
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/misinformation-infodemic-world-vs-virus-podcast/"> </a>
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/misinformation-infodemic-world-vs-virus-podcast/">  [1</a>1] of the deceit which they 
were themselves guilty of. </p>

<p>This was achieved by funding so called<a href="https://in-this-together.com/not-fact-checkers/">  <i class="calibre4">fact checkers</i> [12] to</a><a href="https://in-this-together.com/ccdh-part-1/"> infiltrate and control </a>
<a href="https://in-this-together.com/ccdh-part-1/">the social media [13] platforms. </a>They policed online free speech.  <i class="calibre4">Informed </i>
 <i class="calibre4">influencers</i><a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/british-military-information-war-waged-their-own-population"> also deployed the military [14] to attack the psyche</a> of the public using applied psychological techniques. The people were subjected to a  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i>
terror campaign. </p>

<p>In preparation for this  <i class="calibre4">hybrid war, </i> a propaganda tsunami was unleashed to create 
the myth<a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/censored"> of the so called infodemic [15]. </a>This was done both to protect the 
 <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic, </i> in the short term, and to manufacture the claimed rationale for 
the eventual removal of free speech. </p>

<p>The  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> presented the public with a stark choice. They could either 
make the effort to research and verify information for themselves or rely upon 
whatever they were told by  <i class="calibre4">influencers</i>, either  <i class="calibre4">deceived</i> or  <i class="calibre4">informed</i><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/carole-cadwalladr-should-now-return-her-orwell-prize">, in the </a>
<a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/carole-cadwalladr-should-now-return-her-orwell-prize">mainstream media. [16] and </a> <i class="calibre4">government</i>. </p>

<p>For whatever reason, most were unable or unaware of the need to think critically. 
Consequently widespread disinformation was believed. Utterly bamboozled, many 
victims came to view their own freedom of speech, inalienable right and liberties as 
dangerous. They conceded that their own freedoms were an unacceptable risk to 
their  <i class="calibre4">safety</i>. </p>

<p>The second aspect of the  <i class="calibre4">informed influencers</i> role was<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability"> to provide plausible </a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">deniability [17] for the </a> <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> and, to a great extent, themselves. They xiii
<a id="calibre_link-30"></a>Pseudopandemic
obfuscated their responsibility by claiming decisions were made by a wider group. 
They were either  <i class="calibre4">led by science</i> or serving the wishes of the public. Although many 
scientists disagreed with the policies and the public weren't asked to approve any of
them. </p>

<p>By slotting themselves into the right committees, think tanks, representative bodies 
and governance institutions, the  <i class="calibre4">informed influencers</i> steered the policies while 
obscuring their individual culpability. At the same time, a bulwark was created 
between the  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> and the controlled authorities who implemented the 
policies. </p>

<p>Whenever objections crept into the decision or policy making process, the  <i class="calibre4">informed</i>
 <i class="calibre4">influencers</i> called upon the  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i>. They marshalled their practically 
limitless resources to cherry pick the expert opinion they needed to convince 
wavering  <i class="calibre4">deceived influencers</i>. Ultimately any firm resistance from  <i class="calibre4">objecting </i>
 <i class="calibre4">influencers</i> was simply overruled, outvoted, ignored or removed. </p>

<p>The  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> must therefore have enormous financial power. While they 
only needed to control a relatively small number of  <i class="calibre4">informed influencers</i>, they also 
had to maintain a watchful eye and command over many other important 
influencing groups and authorities. </p>

<p>This was done, without raising too much alarm, through careful investment planning
and grant making. This so-called  <i class="calibre4">philanthropy</i> was then combined with a few 
 <i class="calibre4">informed influencers, </i> appointed to key positions, to achieve international and 
national systemic control. </p>

<p>We will largely focus upon the UK to illustrate how some had the means, 
opportunity and motivation required to orchestrate the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i>. However, 
events in the UK were not unique. The same  <i class="calibre4">modus operandi</i> was evident in 
countries across the world. </p>

<p>The most influential authority, central to the pseudopandemic, was the United 
Nation's special agency the World Health Organisation (WHO). They have 
 <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> form: there is a precedent. For the moment, we will also focus 
upon the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) as exemplars of the financial 
control mechanism. </p>

<p>The BMGF are just one part of a global network of authority. The  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> 
lead that network, but many of their ambitions are shared by the network as a 
whole. Primarily because they serve the interests of network participants 
(stakeholders). </p>

<p>The WHO receives<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210310071205/https://www.who.int/about/funding/"> funding from two sources [18]. </a>Assessed contributions are a percentage of GDP which nation member states have agreed to pay. These 
represent a little less than 20% of the WHO's total budget. Voluntary contributions 
comprise the remaining 80%. </p>

<p>Voluntary contributions are those which member states choose to donate. They 
also include contributions from private grant making foundation, industry bodies, 
intergovernmental organisations, pharmaceutical corporations and other private 
sector interests. </p>

<p>With the Trump administration's temporary<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107212821/https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/14/politics/donald-trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus/index.html"> withholding of the US voluntary </a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201107212821/https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/14/politics/donald-trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus/index.html">contribution [19] (and a small portion</a> of its assessed contribution), Germany were claimed to be the largest single donor. <a href="https://archive.is/ARjbl">The BMGF were said to be the second [20]. </a>
These claims, both by the Trump administration and by the WHO, were deceptive. </p>

<p>The BMGF are also the leading donors to other significant WHO contributors. Most 
notably the GAVI Vaccine alliance, the COVID Solidarity Fund and Rotary 
International. This made the private BMGF the largest single contributor to the 
WHO's overall budget, by some margin. </p>

<p>While former US President Trump made the headlines with his apparent decision to
withhold the US voluntary contribution of around $1 billion, at the same time his 
administration increased the US tax payer's contribution to the BMGF controlled 
GAVI<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201103030618/https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/united-states-endorses-gavi-recommendation-us-116-billion-four-year-commitment"> by $1.16 billion [21]. Ef</a>fectively reducing the US tax payer's theoretical influence over the WHO, while significantly increasing their contribution to it via 
GAVI and the BMGF. </p>

<p>Many claim that the BMGF investment in the WHO does not buy influence. This is 
possible but implausible. </p>

<p>Whether you consider the BMGF to be simply a philanthropic organisation or not, 
the WHO consistently promote the BMGF's publicly stated agenda. It is far more 
plausible that the BMGF funding does influence WHO policy recommendations. 
In an article titled  <i class="calibre4">"Meet The World's Most Powerful Doctor: Bill Gates," </i><a href="https://archive.is/otzsp"> Politico </a>
<a href="https://archive.is/otzsp">observed [22]:</a></p>

<p> <i class="calibre4">"Some billionaires are satisfied with buying themselves an island. Bill </i>
 <i class="calibre4">Gates got a United Nations health agency in Geneva." </i></p>

<p>Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard to focus on his fledgling Microsoft business. It 
isn't clear whether he did so in the knowledge that his mother<a href="https://archive.is/qUcxP"> would secure him [23]</a>
the IBM contract that would ultimately make him a billionaire. Though perhaps we 
should note it was nepotism, not business genius, which assured his future. </p>

<p>Gates has a few honorary degrees but he is neither scientifically nor medically 
qualified. Yet Politico's headline was not entirely inaccurate. Somehow<a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/gates/">, he is seen </a>
<a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/gates/">by millions [24] as some sort of leading</a> global health expert. While academic 
qualifications are no guarantee of expertise and experience is often a better 
measure, would anyone listen to Bill Gates' opinion on global health were it not for 
his so-called philanthropy? How does money make you an expert? </p>

<p>We are about the cover the reasons why we might suspect that Gates may have 
been among the  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i>. In so doing, we can see how the  <i class="calibre4">core </i>
xv
<a id="calibre_link-32"></a>Pseudopandemic
 <i class="calibre4">conspirator's</i> authority was devolved to the  <i class="calibre4">informed influencer</i> who were then able 
to shape policy in the interest of their handlers. </p>

<p>The WHO's current Secretary General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is a 
potential example of an  <i class="calibre4">informed influencer</i>. Ghebreyesus' career has benefited 
considerably from his relationship with the BMGF<a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2017-05-23-global-fund-welcomes-dr-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus-as-director-general-of-who/">. He was the Director of the Global</a>

The BMGF also backed his bid, along with China, to 
become WHO director general in 2017. </p>

<p>The BMGF don't just fund the WHO. They are entwined with public health, biotech 
and<a href="https://archive.is/8Ry8c"> agricultural initiatives [28] the</a> world over. Often in  <i class="calibre4">stakeholder</i> partnership with 
the WHO and various governments. </p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.gavi.org/investing-gavi/funding/donor-profiles/mastercard"> they have heavily backed [29] a bio-metric payment</a> system called 
<a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/africa-trust-stamp-covid-19-vaccine-record-payment-system/269346/">Trust Stamp [30] in</a> West Africa. This combines Mastercard's AI payment technology with the GAVI - Mastercard Wellness Pass. </p>

<p>This creates a technology linking biometric ID and immunity status (based upon 
vaccination, not health) with access to money. With a rather unpalatable whiff of 
neocolonialism, so called fact checkers<a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/09/09/fact-check-mastercard-partnership-vaccines-unrelated-finances/5658366002/"> have been eager to point out [31] that</a> the Trust Stamp initiative currently  <i class="calibre4">only</i> impacts people in developing nations. They 
conclude:</p>

<p> <i class="calibre4">"There is nothing to suggest vaccination refusal would result in prevention </i>
 <i class="calibre4">or loss of any financial freedom." </i></p>

<p>Then why design a system specifically capable of doing so? Undoubtedly many will 
say this is just another coincidence. Though, as we shall explore later, bio-metric ID
linked to vaccine derived immunity, controlling access to finance in a  <i class="calibre4">cashless </i>
 <i class="calibre4">society, </i> is very much part of the  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> motive for the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i>. </p>

<p>If we suspect that Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was a likely  <i class="calibre4">informed influencer</i> 
for the BMGF within the WHO, it should come as no<a href="https://archive.is/YBf9v"> surprise that the WHO warned </a>
<a href="https://archive.is/YBf9v">the world [32] about the COVID dangers</a> of using cash. Despite there being no 
plausible evidence that handling<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7333993/"> cash presents any COVID 19 infection risk [33]. </a></p>

<p>For the WHO, making wildly inaccurate statements is a habit. Though incorrect, 
these  <i class="calibre4">errors</i> consistently benefit the interests of the BMGF and their  <i class="calibre4">partners</i>. </p>

<p>The Pfizer and BioNTech's BNT162b2 was the first vaccine approved for global 
distribution to  <i class="calibre4">combat</i> COVID 19. As we shall see, none of the COVID 19 vaccines 
stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Instead, they are said to reduce the 
health impacts of the resultant COVID 19 disease. </p>

<p>Mass vaccination of the populace has proceeded based upon  <i class="calibre4">emergency</i> approval.

<p>Pfizer are<a href="https://www.gavi.org/operating-model/gavis-partnership-model/industralised-country-pharmaceutical-industry"> GAVI partners [40] and</a> key participants, alongside the BMGF, in the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) programme. The purpose of AMC is to

<p>This guarantees tax payer funded profits for the corporations and their major

 <i class="calibre4">conspirators</i> under the guise of  <i class="calibre4">"saving lives." </i> There is no reason to imagine 
anyone who wittingly participated in the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> had any intention of 
saving anyone. Quite the opposite. </p>

<p>Pfizer are<a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants?q=Pfizer"> BMGF grant recipients [44]. </a>This is a  <i class="calibre4">philanthropic</i> act which provides profits for the BMGF Trust.

Pfizer's apparent vaccine breakthrough. </p>

<p>Bill Gates personal wealth grew from an<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/bill-gates-americas-tax-system-is-not-fair.html"> estimated $109 billion [46] in January 2020</a>
<a href="file:///home/ian/Books/Pseudopandemic/Book%20Complete/For%20Website%20/_blank">to approximately £119 billion [47] by December</a>. Like many of his fellow multi billionaires, the year of the COVID 19  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201029032010/https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/07/covid-19-crisis-boosts-the-fortunes-of-worlds-billionaires"> was hugely profitable [48] </a>
for Bill. Yet still people fantasize that he gives money away. </p>

<p>This $10 billion windfall was thanks, in<a href="https://archive.is/4bXKx"> no small part, to the BMGF Trust [49]: the</a> 
entirely separate BMGF entity managing the Gates' assets. </p>

<p>The BMGF Trust invests in  <i class="calibre4">"for profit" </i> companies, such as Walmart, with their 
primary asset being a sizeable holding<a href="https://archive.is/eqy7E"> of Berkshire Hathaway (BH) inc stock [50]. </a>
In turn, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200504221341if_/https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/"> not only are BH direct Johnson &amp; Johnson shareholders [51] they are also </a>
major holders of Bank of America Corp and Bank of New York Mellon Corp stock. 
These<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200608104358/https://stockzoa.com/ticker/pfe/"> are two of the top 10 Pfizer shareholders [52]. Simply from a financial</a> 
perspective, the last thing the BMGF Trust wanted was a cheap, proven alternative 
to COVID 19 vaccines. </p>

<p>A treatment protocol using the inexpensive<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920304258"> Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in </a>
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920304258">combination with antibiotics and zinc [53] had an excellent</a> 70 year plus safety profile and was able to deliver exactly the same outcome as COVID 19 vaccines. </p>

<p>Like the vaccines, it didn't stop the spread of infection but rather reduced the 
likelihood of anyone becoming seriously ill from COVID 19. </p>

<p>Many people<a href="https://in-this-together.com/?s=Hydroxychloroquine"> tried to highlight [54] the</a> efficacy and safety of this and other 
treatment protocols for COVID 19 throughout the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i>. The controlled 
authorities<a href="https://archive.is/QvQjH"> simply refused to countenance them, [55] often</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200816123708/https://covexit.com/new-brazilian-study-shows-telemedicine-hydroxychloroquine-treatment-reduce-need-for-hospitalization/"> despite their apparent </a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200816123708/https://covexit.com/new-brazilian-study-shows-telemedicine-hydroxychloroquine-treatment-reduce-need-for-hospitalization/">life saving [56] potential. </a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210321205533/https://ivmmeta.com/">Numerous studies [57] show that the anti-</a>parasitic drug Ivermectin is also effective in reducing the symptoms of COVID 19. The possibility that it could have reduced 
COVID 19 mortality by 83% was something the WHO acknowledg<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126064857/https://swprs.org/who-preliminary-review-confirms-ivermectin-effectiveness/">ed in their own </a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126064857/https://swprs.org/who-preliminary-review-confirms-ivermectin-effectiveness/">studies [58]. </a></p>

<p>As early as April 2020 Australian scientists published a paper which showed that 
Ivermectin completely killed off<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210305193749/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011"> replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [59] in the </a>
laboratory. Further  <i class="calibre4">"apex research" </i><a href="https://archive.is/jRYnw"> on Ivermectin then came under the control [60] </a>
of the BMGF, the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (via their Wellcome Trust 
Foundation) and Mastercard, in the guise of their joint COVID 19  <i class="calibre4">"therapeutics </i>
 <i class="calibre4">accelerator." </i></p>

<p>This effectively ended any hope of HCQ, Ivermectin, or other promising treatment 
protocols, <a href="https://archive.is/Jbryp"> such as high dose use of vitamin D [61] ever being approved</a> for 
treatment of COVID 19. Mark Suzman (CEO of the BMGF) clearly<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210321151241/https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/coronavirus-mark-suzman-therapeutics"> stated what the </a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210321151241/https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/coronavirus-mark-suzman-therapeutics">purpose [62] of the </a> <i class="calibre4">therapeutics accelerator</i> was:</p>

<p> <i class="calibre4">"We believe we can help by partnering with private and philanthropic </i>
 <i class="calibre4">enterprises to lower the financial risk.. for biotech and pharmaceutical </i>
 <i class="calibre4">companies developing antivirals for COVID-19.. The only way to treat a </i>
 <i class="calibre4">viral infection, such as COVID-19, is with antiviral drugs......The best way </i>
 <i class="calibre4">to prevent an infectious disease is with a vaccine." </i></p>

<p>The problem for pharmaceutical corporations with treatments like the HCQ protocol, 
Ivermectin or high dose VitD, is that they are  <i class="calibre4">generic</i>. This means no one owns a 
patent and small to medium size manufacturers can compete in the market. This 
lowers the price, thus removing the profit incentive for multinational corporations. </p>

<p>If a generic drug proves just as effective as new patented antivirals, developed by 
pharmaceutical corporations, their development costs will have been wasted. 
Effective generic treatments increase pharmaceutical corporation's  <i class="calibre4">financial risk</i>, 
contrary to the stated purpose of the BMGF  <i class="calibre4">therapeutic accelerator. </i></p>

<p>Despite<a href="https://archive.is/GJJdd"> there being overwhelming scientific evidence [63] that</a> these generic 
treatments warranted further research,  <i class="calibre4">"apex research" </i> (pharmaceutical 
corporations funded studies) were actively resisted by  <i class="calibre4">Big Pharma</i>. For example, 
the pharmaceutical giant Merck released a press statement on Ivermectin which 
falsely claimed there was "  <i class="calibre4">no scientific basis" </i> for further trials. It is difficult to see 
how this can be described as anything<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210209050735/https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"> other than entirely false [64]. </a></p>

<p>However, making money (or not making it) wasn't the primary reason why these 
treatment protocols were shunned by the global corporate funded, scientific 
establishment. The threat they posed to vaccine uptake was a major concern. 
Vaccines that do little more than reduce symptoms aren't necessary if you can pop 
into your local chemist and buy an inexpensive, over the counter medication that 
does the same thing. </p>

<p>This is not to claim that a vaccine that worked wouldn't be welcome, but patient 
choice was certainly unwelcome among those who intended to use vaccines for 
much more than simply protecting people against a disease. The vaccines were a 
key element of the  <i class="calibre4">biosecurity State</i> the  <i class="calibre4">core conspirators</i> wished to construct. </p>

<p>Ivermectin, VitD, and Hydroxychloroquine treatment protocols presented a direct 
threat to this ambition. By looking at how they treated just one of these treatments 
(Hydroxycholoroquine) we can see how the centralised global system of authority 
dealt with any scientific or medical threat to  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> objectives. </p>

<p>In order<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200605033240/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/covid-19-lancet-retracts-paper-that-halted-hydroxychloroquine-trials"> to discredit HCQ the WHO cited a blatantly fraudulent [65] scientific</a> paper published in the Lancet. The Lancet is also funded<a href="https://archive.is/ZoP1d"> by the WHO and the BMGF [66] </a>
among others. The paper was written by a bio research company called 
<a href="https://in-this-together.com/hydroxychloroquine-disgrace-part-1/">Surgisphere [67]. </a></p>

<p>The WHO used this fake science to suspend global Hydroxychloroquine trials for 
COVID 19, within days of their commencement. <a href="https://archive.is/E7cwE">The MSM then spread this </a>
<a href="https://archive.is/E7cwE">fraudulent science [68] worldwide. </a></p>

<p>The UK's MHRA responded to the WHO announcement with great haste. <a href="https://in-this-together.com/hydroxychloroquine-disgrace-part-2/">They shut</a>
<a href="https://in-this-together.com/hydroxychloroquine-disgrace-part-2/">down the trials they could [69] and</a> pressured researchers to curtail other trials. In 2017 the MHRA<a href="https://archive.is/pWMm4"> were operational partners [70] with</a><a href="https://archive.is/zSJdj"> the BMGF and are BMGF grant</a>
<a href="https://archive.is/zSJdj">recipients [71]. </a></p>

<p>Throughout the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i>, a concerted media campaign was waged against
HCQ and the eminent scientists and physicians who advocated it. Many of the 
media organisations involved in the propaganda operation<a href="https://archive.is/nZbzX"> were also funded by the </a>
<a href="https://archive.is/nZbzX">BMGF [72]. </a></p>

<p>The propaga<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32458969/">nda was designed to deceive the public [73]. It focused upon</a> the 
dangers of extremely high doses of HCQ to treat people with advanced COVID 19 
and at no stage informed the public that its proposed use was a part of a broader 
treatment protocol using lower doses in the early onset of the disease. Saving life 
was not on the  <i class="calibre4">pseudopandemic</i> agenda. </p>

<p>The Surgisphere paper the WHO used to besmirch HCQ was so poor that many 
scientists and<a href="file:///home/ian/Books/Pseudopandemic/Book%20Complete/For%20Website%20/_blank"> medical researchers immediately complained [74] to</a> the Lancet. The Lancet were forced to withdraw the paper, but not before<a href="https://archive.is/0EBNf"> putting up considerable </a>
<a href="https://archive.is/0EBNf">resistance [75]</a></p>

<p>The WHO are supposed to be the world's leading health authority. Yet they were 
incapable of spotting obvious scientific fraud which many other qualified  <i class="calibre4">experts</i> 
identified with ease. The Lancet retracted the paper and the WHO reinstated some 
of the<a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/the-hydroxychloroquine-scandal"> trials. None of the HCQ trials approved by the WHO [76] were designed</a> to investigate either the recommended dosage or the HCQ treatment protocol. </p>

<p>Making dubious statements and counterproductive decisions, consistently 
advancing the objectives of their financiers, is common practice for the WHO. We 
will cover more examples but, before we do, let's consider what this implies. </p>

<p>One possibility is that the WHO are inept and make statements based upon limited 
evidence without considering the implications. Their decision making is based upon 
a weak grasp of medical science and public health policy and these persistent 
errors just happen to coalesce with the interests of the people who fund them. </p>

<p>Or, the evidence suggests that the WHO are corrupt. They act as a policy vehicle 
for a small handful of powerful interest groups who exploit public health policy to 
advance their own agenda. </p>
