<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>We are living through a global transformation. Our society, culture, economy and 
even our humanity is undergoing a process of change at the behest of our leaders. 
This book attempts to explain who those leaders are, what the transition is 
propelling us towards and why our leaders are taking us there. </p>

<p>The policy response to the COVID 19 crisis has been opposed by a large minority 
but supported by the overwhelming majority. Among those who question what we 
are told about COVID 19 are a contingent who wish to exercise their  <i>inalienable </i>
 <i>rights</i> and freedoms. Often described as  <i>anti-lockdown, anti-science</i>,  <i>anti-vaxxers</i> 
or  <i>conspiracy theorists, </i> on the whole, they are not opposed to anything other than 
dictatorship and slavery. Rather they are  <i>pro-freedom</i>,  <i>pro-science (pro-medical </i>
 <i>science)</i> and  <i>pro-truth</i>. </p>

<p>The people who have been marginalised, censored, berated by many, and 
physically attacked by the authorities, are the people who most vociferously 
advocate the freedoms our democratic societies are supposedly based upon. The 
freedoms which generations before us struggled, fought and died to protect. While 
government frequently exult us to honour this sacrifice it seems it is currently 
inconvenient for them to do so. </p>

<p>Those who appear to unquestioningly support the policy response to the COVID 19 
pandemic claim that these freedoms and rights don't matter when we are faced with
a global emergency. It is difficult to understand this argument. </p>

<p>In what way are freedom of speech, expression and thought dangerous? 
Dangerous to whom? How do they inhibit our ability to respond to a genuine 
emergency? </p>

<p>Governments around the world are determined that we will embrace the idea of 
 <i>human rights</i>. They claim that everything they do is based upon these <i> rights</i> and 
their determination to  <i>keep us safe</i>. </p>

<p> <i>Human rights</i> are permissions written down on pieces of paper by other human 
beings. A system of global human rights is a system of government issued permits 
which defines what we are or are not  <i>allowed</i> to do. </p>

<p>As human rights are just words written on pieces of paper they can be changed, 
reinterpreted and ignored. They are neither immutable nor inalienable. This is why 
governments are so eager for us to place our faith in  <i>human rights</i>. It enables them 
to tell us what is permitted. </p>

<p>Governments are pathologically allergic to the concept of  <i>inalienable rights</i>. They 
are mentioned just once in the preamble to the United Nations Universal 
Declaration of Human rights and are omitted entirely from the Declaration itself. 

<p>Article 2 states:</p>

<p> <i>"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this </i>
 <i>Declaration." </i></p>

<p>In other words, no one is entitled to any rights that are not stipulated in the 
Declaration. Unlike inalienable rights, which every human being is born with and no 
human being can legitimately deny,  <i>human rights</i> are a political construct. </p>

<p>The Declaration then goes on to describe our rights to life, liberty, health, education 
and various freedoms. Who could disagree with these noble principles? </p>

<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights employs a form of propaganda called 
 <i>Card Stacking</i>. By presenting a lengthy list of righteous humanitarian goals, to 
which no reasonable person could object, it hides the insidious and unacceptable 
reality. Unless we are observant we are easily fooled by  <i>Card Stacking</i>. The devil is 
 <i>always</i> in the detail. </p>

<p>Article 29 states:</p>

<p> <i>"In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone </i><b>shall be subject </b>
<b>only to such limitations as are determined by law</b> <i> solely for the </i>
 <i>purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and </i>
 <i>freedoms of others </i><b>and</b> <i> </i><b>of meeting the just requirements of</b> <i> morality, </i>
<b>public order</b> <i> </i><b>and the general welfare</b> <i> in a democratic society. </i><b>These </b>
<b>rights</b> <i> </i><b>and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the </b>
<b>purposes and principles of the United Nations</b> <i>." </i></p>

<p>Human rights are not rights at all. They can be denied by any law (legislation) 
enacted by any government (politician). As we have just experienced with  <i>the </i>
 <i>Coronavirus Act</i> in the UK,  <i>human rights</i> are expendable to protect  <i>"public order </i>
 <i>and the general welfare." </i> Under the U.N. Declaration they can be and are ignored 
whenever the government sees fit. They are nothing but empty words written on 
pieces of paper. </p>

<p>A society based upon human rights has no rights. Those who think human rights 
are expendable in emergencies are correct. They are expendable  <i>“whenever.” </i></p>

<p>What they fail to grasp is that inalienable rights can never be extinguished. 
Throughout this book the consistent, unspoken theme is the disregard for our 
inalienable rights. Not just among those who intentionally ignore them but also 
among a population who appear to have forgotten what they are and why, without 
them, we have nothing. </p>

<p>Inalienable right are not permits bestowed upon us by government. They are 
universal concepts of natural justice inherent to Natural or God's law. They exist in 
nature, not on pieces of paper. They are immutable and inalienable and can be 
perceived by every emotional being, including humans. </p>

<p>No one needs a written law to tell them that it is wrong to harm a defenceless child 
or commit other acts of violence. We don't need to be told that it is wrong to take 
something that is not ours without the permission of the owner. We feel that it is 
wrong, we experience our wrongdoing as guilt. Inalienable rights are emotionally 
resonant and, as soon as we are able to experience emotion, we can sense them. </p>

<p>We are born capable of emotion. We are born with the ability to understand the 
difference between right and wrong. We are born with inalienable rights. The few of 
us who are incapable of making the distinction are suffering from personality 
disorders. </p>

<p>Sociopaths and psychopaths are unable to distinguish between right and wrong 
because they lack natural human emotional responses. Their egos convince them 
that they are  <i>special</i> and therefore they do not feel the need to observe other’s 
rights. For them, only that which serves their purpose has value. Inalienable rights 
are incomprehensible for the psychopath and the sociopath. </p>

<p>When these people collude, their only goal is to serve their own collective interests 
and deny the rest of us our rights. Throughout our history generations of these 
rights abusers have caused untold chaos and human misery in pursuit of their 
ambitions. They are and always have been the most dangerous threat we have 
ever faced. Their actions are consistently wrong and, as sovereign human beings 
with inalienable rights, it is our duty to disarm any undue influence they may hold 
over anyone. </p>

<p>The rest of us innately possess empathy, remorse and compassion. We try to avoid 
antisocial behaviour, where we might cause harm or loss to others, because we 
instinctively know that we do not have the right to hurt other people. If we act in 
good conscience and in observance of our own and other’s rights, whatever we do 
is right and it is our right to do it. </p>

<p>Inalienable rights are solely defined by what is right and what is wrong. Anything we
do which does not cause harm or loss to another human being (including denial of 
their rights) is right and it is our right. We are free to exercise our rights at all times 
and  <i>"freedom" </i> is defined as the unhindered freedom to exercise our rights. </p>

<p>We do not define what is right or what is wrong. We don't decide to feel guilt or 
shame, nor can we feel assured by our own honourable action if that assurance 
isn't genuinely felt. </p>

<p>Rights are not our property. We don't own them just as we don't own the physical 
space we inhabit. We occupy our place in space and time and we occupy our 
individual rights. While we live, we are the rightful custodian of our rights but no one
 <i>permits</i> us to occupy them and they cannot be taken from us. They are our 
inalienable rights. </p>

<p>While we exist it is impossible for us to give away our rights, just as it is for us to 
give away our place in space and time. Our rights encapsulate us but we don't 
possess them. When we die we no longer occupy a physical place in space and 
time but both continue in our absence, as do inalienable rights. </p>

<p>To fail to defend our rights against those who would seek to stop us exercising them
contravenes Natural Law and is therefore wrong. We all know this, we naturally 
react defensively when we feel someone is attempting to deny our freedom to 
exercise our inalienable rights. </p>

<p>Psychopaths and sociopaths have learned this truth from experience. They have 
come to place great value upon deception as the best way to coerce us into 
accepting that they have the right to ignore our inalienable rights. By neither 
exercising nor defending our inalienable rights we permit them to  <i>do</i>  <i>as they wilt</i>. </p>

<p>This abrogation of our rights  <i>always</i> causes harm because psychopaths and 
sociopaths  <i>always</i> harm or cause loss to others. To idly stand by and do nothing, in 
the certain knowledge that harm or loss is being inflicted upon others, is negligent. 
To passively allow harm or loss to be inflicted upon ourselves is equally negligent. 
Negligence is wrong and we have no right to be negligent. </p>

<p>It is  <i>always</i> wrong to initiate the use of force but we might have to use minimum 
force to defend our rights against those who commit the wrong of trying to deny us 
our rights. We may harm them in that defence, but we did not initiate the use of 
minimum force and it is our duty as human beings to defend our rights. </p>

<p>Anything which, either by intent or neglect, initiates the causation of harm or loss to 
another human being is wrong. It is not a right that any human being can ever 
exercise. Inalienable rights are universal and are undeniably occupied  <i>in equal </i>
 <i>measure</i> by every human being. All those who cause harm are wrong and we must 
defend our individual rights because they are everyone's rights  <i>in equal measure</i>. </p>

<p>The only justice is natural justice. It is the restoration of right when a wrong is 
committed. Natural justice is an expression of Natural Law (God's Law) which is the
universal balance between chaos and order. Natural Law is unforgiving, it does not 
care what we think or imagine to be true. It is balance, it is the truth and it is 
absolute. </p>

<p>Those who do not respect inalienable rights must be brought to natural justice. We 
all share the responsibility to defend everyone's freedom  <i>in equal measure</i>. All 
peaceable means must be exhausted in the pursuit of justice. The minimal use of 
force is solely a right of self-defence but an attack on one human being's inalienable
rights is an attack on all human beings inalienable rights  <i>in equal measure</i>. </p>

<p>So far, despite all the community groups we frequently identify with, such as 
English, Democrat, Black, LGBTQ+, Green or Conservative, the community we 
have universally failed to identify with is  <i>human being</i>. Instead, we have been 
convinced to divide ourselves into ever smaller social subdivisions in search of the 
individuality which increasingly eludes us and can seemingly only be expressed in 
terms of the group we believe we belong to. </p>

<p>It is as if identifying as a human being, the most intelligent, creative and resourceful 
creature ever to walk the Earth, is somehow not good enough. </p>

<p>Or perhaps it is because doing so would force us to confront our existence. Rather 
than express our individual truth, as many seem to want to do, we would need to 
accept that there is only one abiding truth and it is not relative to us. We are a part 
of it. </p>

<p>We would be one among 7.8 billion other souls who are not  <i>"other" </i> but rather 
family. Regardless of our nationality, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, 
disability or what team we support, we would be part of the whole and if one of us 
suffers we all suffer. </p>

<p>Instead of defining our individuality through our affiliation to a belief system or a 
social construct, we would have to do it through our own independent thoughts and 
actions. We would be entirely responsible for ourselves and, as human beings, we 
would share an  <i>equal measure</i> of responsibility for each other and the conduct of all
humanity. We would have no one to blame for our travesties but ourselves and all 
achievements would be ours. </p>

<p>We have been deceived into imagining we have  <i>human rights</i> and in doing so we 
have neglected our duty to defend humanity's inalienable rights. Our irresponsible 
behaviour, apathy and credulity has brought us, most assuredly, to the brink of a 
global dictatorship. </p>

<p>Whether that malevolent plan succeeds or fails is up to us. If you seek a leader to 
take responsibility and to stand up against this tyranny then look in the mirror. </p>

<p>Many will strongly disagree with the conclusions in this book. This is as it should be. 
There's nothing wrong with debate, it is the silencing of debate that should concern 
us. Evidence is cited throughout <i> Pseudopandemic</i>. It has been necessary to 
provide links to archived citations because many of the scientific articles and 
papers, news reports and qualified opinion pieces have already been censored. </p>

<p>I do not assert that  <i>“Pseudopandemic" </i> is the truth, only that I have tried to present 
the truth to the best of my knowledge and understanding. You have the evidence 
before you, please explore it, look for more and form your own conclusions. 
Freedom is your inalienable right. Make of it what you will. </p>

<p> <i>"Our culture is predicated upon the idea that truth in speech is of divine </i>
 <i>significance. It is the fundamental presupposition of our culture. If you </i>
 <i>believe that then you act it out and you take the consequences. You are </i>
 <i>going to take the consequences one way or the other. So do you want the </i>
 <i>truth on your side or do you want to hide behind falsehoods?" </i></p>
